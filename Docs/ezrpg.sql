The right side shows more information about the field you are on. It shows you the coordinates, the name of the surrounding, the name of the resource and the name of the Player claiming the field.\r\nBelow that information you can find the navigation table. It offers you the eight moving directions and a central action button. This button is a sword or a shield. If someone else claims the field there is a sword and that means you have to attack the person claiming before other actions can be done. If noone or you are claiming the field you can look for random stuff or gather the resources on the field. You do not have to claim an unclaimed field if you want to gather stuff there, but others can come there, too. You have to calim and defend the spot in case to keep others out.\r\n --- <b>Details</b >');

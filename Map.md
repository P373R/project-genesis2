# Map module #

The Map module shows you where you are in the world of Project-Genesis2. You can evoke a lot of actions while you are on a field. You can navigate in all 8 directions and you are able to command you harvester to get resources or to cruse around and try to find something. The module shows you who is on the field, what type of water is on it and who claims the field as their own.
